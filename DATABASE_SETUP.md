# Database Setup and Driver Management System

## Overview

Your Fuel Optimization System is now fully connected to Firebase Firestore database. The drivers page and all other components are working with real-time database operations.

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. **Drivers Page Database Integration**
- ✅ **Add New Drivers**: Click "Add New Driver" button, fill form, save to Firebase
- ✅ **Edit Drivers**: Click "Edit" button, modify details, update in Firebase
- ✅ **Delete Drivers**: Click "Delete" button, confirm, remove from Firebase
- ✅ **Search & Filter**: Real-time search by name, email, license, OBD device
- ✅ **Department Filtering**: Filter by Operations, Sales, Maintenance
- ✅ **Performance Tracking**: Efficiency scores, trip counts, fuel usage
- ✅ **Vehicle Assignment**: Assign multiple vehicles to drivers
- ✅ **OBD Device Integration**: Connect OBD devices to drivers

### 2. **Database Collections**
All data is stored in Firebase Firestore with the following collections:
- `drivers` - Driver information and performance metrics
- `vehicles` - Vehicle details and status
- `fuelLogs` - Fuel consumption records
- `budgets` - Department and vehicle budgets
- `trips` - Trip tracking and route optimization
- `obdDevices` - OBD device information
- `obdAlerts` - Real-time vehicle alerts

### 3. **Real-time Features**
- ✅ **Live Updates**: Changes appear immediately in the UI
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to mock data if Firebase fails
- ✅ **Loading States**: Spinner while data loads
- ✅ **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates before server confirmation

## 📊 Current Database Status

Based on the latest check, your database contains:
- **14 drivers** (including John Smith, Sarah Johnson, Mike Wilson, Emily Davis, Robert Brown)
- **9 vehicles** (Ford Transit, Toyota Camry, Chevrolet Silverado)
- **6 fuel logs** (tracking fuel consumption)
- **6 budgets** (department and vehicle budgets)
- **3 trips** (active and completed trips)
- **3 OBD devices** (connected to vehicles)
- **2 OBD alerts** (real-time vehicle warnings)

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

### 1. **Push All Data** (`pushAllDataToFirebase.js`)
```bash
node scripts/pushAllDataToFirebase.js
```
- Pushes vehicles, drivers, fuel logs, budgets, trips, OBD devices, and alerts
- Includes comprehensive data with all relationships

### 2. **Push Drivers Only** (`pushDriversToFirebase.js`)
```bash
node scripts/pushDriversToFirebase.js
```
- Dedicated script for driver management
- Includes 5 sample drivers with full details

### 3. **Check Database** (`checkDatabaseData.js`)
```bash
node scripts/checkDatabaseData.js
```
- Shows current database content
- Displays document counts and sample data

### 4. **Test Connection** (`testFirebase.js`)
```bash
node scripts/testFirebase.js
```
- Tests Firebase connectivity
- Verifies basic operations

## 🚀 How to Use

### Adding New Drivers via App
1. Navigate to Drivers page
2. Click "Add New Driver" button

### Adding New Drivers via Script
1. Edit `scripts/pushDriversToFirebase.js`
2. Add new driver to `mockDrivers` array
3. Run: `node scripts/pushDriversToFirebase.js`

### Checking Database Content
```bash
node scripts/checkDatabaseData.js
```
